# From Unknown to Have Something (OSCP)


Hi all here i will share my journey to become an “OSCP” certified holder

## My prior experience

I have worked in InfoSec for around 2 years.I felt like doing OSCP would better help me to find and critical thinking when conduct penetration testing.

## What did I use to study?

I will go into some more detail about these resources after; however, I used Virtual Hacking Labs, Hack the Box, PWK, Ippsec Videos and Tib3rius’ privilege escalation courses.

## Virtual Hacking Labs


## Hack The Box

I’m sure the vast majority have already heard of Hack The Box. It’s a great site with many different boxes, ranging from Easy to Insane. Some of these boxes can be very CTFy and most are probably out of scope for the OSCP exam. There is a list compiled by TJ Null, which goes through some OSCP like boxes, I would suggest 90% of these be completed before attempting the exam. Hack The Box is arguably the best when it comes to priv esc as there is lots of variety. To do the boxes on the list you will have to buy HTB VIP, which is around £10 a month.
