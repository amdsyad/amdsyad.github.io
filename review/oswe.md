Hi everyone, Today i received that i passed the oswe exam, ok let's jump into the what is my approach and how i tackle the oswe module and lab.


## Pre OSWE

Before i enroll, i also know the oswe design to identify vulnerability on source code level and also need to automated the exploitation process. you can view the course prerequisites here.

The prerequisites look like we need to know atleas one programming language to automated our exploitation process.

## My approach

### 1st approach

Before enroll i starting to learn programming language like PHP (Object-oriented programming) OOP i learn from [Edvin Diaz](https://www.udemy.com/course/oop-php-object-oriented-programing-with-project-1-course/). This course will teach you how to create a web application using oop style and also include the CRUD part.


### 2nd approach
